## How to add/update your language?

- Copy the most up-to-date translation from the default translation folder **en**. English is the default language so it will always be the most up-to-date.
- If your language is missing just create a new folder and copy all **en** files, if you are updating a language just copy the missing files or lines.
- Translate everything and make a pull request.
